/* Handling 404 errors with the notFound function

Another way you can handle errors gracefully is by using the notFound function. While error.tsx is useful for catching uncaught exceptions, notFound can be used when you try to fetch a resource that doesn't exist.

For example, visit http://localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices/2e94d1ed-d220-449f-9f11-f0bbceed9645/edit

.

This is a fake UUID that doesn't exist in your database.

You'll immediately see error.tsx kicks in because this is a child route of /invoices where error.tsx is defined.

However, if you want to be more specific, you can show a 404 error to tell the user the resource they're trying to access hasn't been found. */
